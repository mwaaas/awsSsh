**_awsSsh_**

This is an utility to help us ssh to aws elastic beanstalk and 
ecs 

There is already aws tool `eb ssh` which works well, awsSsh is not meant
to replace it. Its only that for `eb ssh` to work you need to have done 
`eb init` which works well but if you don't want to do that this tool is for you.
